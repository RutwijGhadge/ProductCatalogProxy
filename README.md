# ProductCatalogProxy
ProductCatalogProxy is a Spring Bootâ€“based microservice for an e-commerce application. It exposes RESTful APIs for performing CRUD operations on product data and acts as a proxy to the Fake Store API. This service implements controller and service layers, integrates with the external API, and provides centralized exception handling for robustness.
